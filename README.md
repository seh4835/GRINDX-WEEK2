# 📌 Overview

During the second week of my internship, I focused on advancing from frontend interactivity with JavaScript to understanding the foundations of backend development. The projects I worked on gave me a complete picture of how a user interacts with an application on the frontend, how the backend processes requests, and how data is shared between the two through APIs.

This week’s work included building a To-Do List application, experimenting with Node.js servers, working with Express.js routes, and developing a Mock JSON API. These projects helped me gain practical experience and also strengthened my problem-solving and debugging skills.

# 📝 To-Do List Application

The To-Do List application was my first step in applying JavaScript in a practical project. This app allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks. It was a simple but effective exercise in building interactivity.

Through this project, I learned how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to create and manage dynamic content. Every action in the app — whether adding a task, marking it as complete, or removing it — was driven entirely by JavaScript. It showed me how important event handling and conditional logic are for creating a smooth user experience.

This project gave me confidence in working with HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for functionality, and it clearly demonstrated the role of JavaScript in enhancing static web pages.

# 🌐 Node.js Server

Moving to the backend, I created my first server using Node.js. This was a turning point because it introduced me to the idea that JavaScript is not limited to the browser but can also power servers.

The server responded with a simple “Hello World” message when accessed through the browser. Although basic, this project was very important as it helped me understand the request–response cycle: the client sends a request to the server, and the server processes it before sending back a response.

This project made me more comfortable with backend concepts and gave me a foundation to later work with frameworks like Express.js.

# ⚡ Express.js Application

After getting familiar with Node.js, I transitioned to Express.js, which simplifies the process of building servers and APIs. In this project, I created routes to handle both GET and POST requests.

This was my first real introduction to RESTful APIs, where different routes could perform different functions. The GET route returned a simple response, while the POST route accepted data and responded back with it. Testing these endpoints using Postman gave me valuable exposure to how developers interact with and verify backend services.

This project deepened my understanding of server-side logic, routes, and handling data, and it felt like a major step toward becoming a full stack developer.

# 📊 Mock JSON API

The final project of this week involved creating a Mock JSON API. This simulated how real-world APIs provide structured data to clients. By defining sample JSON objects (such as tasks or users) and serving them through Express, I built an endpoint that could be accessed to return data in JSON format.

This project connected everything I had learned so far. It helped me see how the frontend could consume data from the backend, and how APIs form the bridge between the two. It also reinforced the importance of JSON as a universal format for data exchange in modern applications.
